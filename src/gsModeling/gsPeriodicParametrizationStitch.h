/**
 * A class for computing periodic parametrizations of closed
 * (cylinder-like) surface meshes. The result will be periodic in the
 * u-direction and the parameter domain will be [0, 1]^2. This class is an alternative to
 * gsPeriodicParametrizationOverlap. The idea is adapted from
 *
 * - Tong, Y., Alliez, P., Cohen-Steiner, D., Desbrun, M.: Designing
 * quadrangulations with discrete harmonic forms, in: Sheffer, A.,
 * Polthier, K. (Eds.), Symposium on Geometry Processing,
 * Eurographics. pp. 201â€“210, 2006,
 * 
 * where it was used constructing discrete harmonic mappings on
 * arbitrary topology.
 *
 * Main idea
 * =========
 *
 * The user prescribes the u-values of the points on the lower and
 * upper boundaries (i.e., v = 0 and v = 1, respectively). In
 * addition, they are required to provide a *stitch*: a list of
 * vertices forming a simple polyline connecting the vertices with the
 * highest u-value on v=0 and v=1, which serves as a first guess for
 * the location of the periodic interface.
 *
 * The equations for the inner vertices (depicted with empty circles
 * in the figure below) are assembled by the methods of the parent
 * class. For vertices on the stitch (full squares) the u-coordinate
 * of their neighbours to the right (empty squares) is temporarily
 * increased by one; similarly, when computing the empty-squared
 * neighbours, the u-coordinate from the full-square neighbours is
 * decreased by one.
